    "### **Mathematic Concepts**\n",
    "#### 1. Vectors and Matrices\n",
    "##### Vectors\n",
    "A vector is an ordered list of numbers, represented as a row: $x=[x_1,x_2,x_3]$. In python, it is usually represented as a list `x=[x1,x2,x3]`. A more common way to manipulate vectors in python is through np.array, which can be defined by converting a list or with numbers. `x_np=np.array([1,2,3])`.Multidimensional arrays can also be defined by`np.ndarray` method. The length of the vector can be extracted by `len(a)`, or `a.size()` if a is a np array.\n",
    "##### Vector Operations\n",
    "Some important operations of a vector are:\n",
    "- Addtion: for two vectors with equal length, the sum of them is just a vector with the same length where each component of the resulting vector is the sum of both components in the original vector (elementwise).\n",
    "- Scalar multiplication: $c\\cdot [x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n] = [cx_1,cx_2,\\cdots, cx_n]$\n",
    "- Dot Product: $x\\cdot y = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i$. In python, this can be easily done by `np.dot(a,b)`.\n",
    "- Norm: The norm of a vector, or the macnitude of the vector, is $||x||=\\sqrt{x_1^2,x_2^2,\\cdots,x_n^2}$. In python, the norm of a vector can be calculated by `np.linalg.norm(X)`.\n",
    "##### Matrix\n",
    "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. A matrix that is n by m means that it has n rows and m columns. For example, the following matrix A is a 3*2 matrix:\n",
    "$$A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "A vector can be seen as a special type of matrix where the **size is n by 1 or 1 by n**. In python, a matrix can be defined as `np.array` or `np.ndarray`. To extract the shape of the matrix $A=np.ndarray()$, one can use `A.shape()`. A matrix whose number of columns is equal to the number of rows is called a **square matrix**.\n",

    "##### Matrix Operations\n",
    "- Addition: the addition between two matrices with the same size is element-wise.\n",
    "- Multiplication: In order to perform multiplication between two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. That is, in order to perform $AB$, $A$ and $B$ must have **shape i by n, and n by j**, respectively. The result is an **i by j** matrix.To perform matrix multiplication in python, one can use `np.dot(A,B)`.\n",
    "- Transpose: an operator that flips a matrix over its diagonal by switching the row and column indices of matrix B and producing another matrix. Transpose of a matrix in python is`A.T` suppose A is any matrix.\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "- Determinant: the determinant is a scalar-valued function of the entries of a **square matrix**. The determinant of a square matrix can be represented as either $det(A)$ or $|A|$. It is calculated as follows. For square matrices that is larger than 3 by 3, the determinant could be tedious to calculate, but is can be eaasily be done with `np.linalg.det(A)`.\n",

    "<br>For example, the probability of getting a head with a fair coin is $P=\\frac{1}{2}$. The pre-selected model here is a fair coin, which we assumed that the chances of getting a head and getting a tail are the same. The estimation of probability is done **before any events occur**. The nature of probability is **interpreting a model**.\n",
    "##### Likelihood\n",
    "Although one can still understand likelihood as \"chance of an event occurance\", it is defined differently in statistics. In statistics, likelihood is the **plausibility of a model** (usually equal to a set of parameters or a single parameter), given an observation. Likelihood is represented as $L(\\theta|D)$, where $D$ is the observation (data) and $\\theta$ is the parameter set whose plausibility is being evaluated.It is interpreted as \"the possibility of the observed data **given some parameters**\".

This means this model is the most plausible one among three. As you may noticed, the \"most plausible\" model based on our likelihood calculation does not align with our understanding about a fair coin, whose chance to get a head is 50%.

Another factor in this example is that the number of datapoints involved is too **small**, which indicates high fluctuation.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Definition\n",
    "Bayes's theorem is a rule to update the probability when new information is available. New information could be our assumptions, observations, and new data. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two events, baye's theorem is expressed as the following:\n",
    "$$P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $P(A|B)$ is called the **Posterior**, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$.\n",
    "- $P(A)$ is called the **Prior**, which is our **original** belief of $A$.\n",
    "- $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, where is explains how well $A$ explains $B$.\n",
    "- $P(B)$ is a normalizing factor, usually called normalizing constant or the Marginal probability. It is **neglected** in some usecases including gaussian process, which will be explained later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine leaning, $A$ in the equation above usually represents the **data** that we want to probe, and $B$ is usually either an **evidence**(some observation), or an **assumption** we made. Therefore, the equation is answering the quesion: given new information $B$, which could be evidence or assumption, how should we update our understanding of $A$?\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is the most important concept toward Gaussian Process, as the training of gaussian process is highly dependent on the theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Difference between Conditional Probability\n",
    "In a previous example where we have the data of apperal products from different locations, the concept of conditional probability $P(A|B)$ was illustrated. Since the Bayes' Theorem is also calculating the conditional probability, but with a much more complicated formula, why don't we just use the simpler one?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that the previous example, where we know **everything** about the data, is extremely rare and nearly impposible in real life, because usually the dataset is way **bigger** and therefore way **harder** to acquire every piece of distribution information.Take the following problem as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** The overall rate of having a rare disease in an area is $2\\%$. The disease could be tested, but the test is only $95\\%$ accurate. Given a person is tested positive, how likely is that the person truly has the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** First of all, we want to know if we can calculate the result directly. Suppose we **Know** everyone who has the disease and that we are able to **make everyone do a test** and obtain the result, the calculation should be pretty simple, as we only need to calculate the conditional probability:\n",
    "$$P(Disease|Positive)=\\frac{P(Disease,Positive)}{P(Positive)}$$\n",
    "However, this is very unrealistic, majorly because the joint probability $P(Disease,Positive)$ requires unfathomably large amount of resource and time. Here is how Baye's Theorem can help us:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes' Theorem Approach** With Bayes' Theorem, we first need to identify the terms.\n",
    "- Posterior $P(Disease|Positive)$:The probability of getting disease given that the test is positive.\n",
    "- Prior $P(Disease)$: The probability of getting a disease is $2\\%$, something we know.\n",
    "- Likelihood $P(Positive|Disease)$: How accurate the test results are. You can understand this term with the definition of likelihood: Disease is the data, and testing is the parameter. The term says how plausible the parameter \"testing\" is, which is the same as \"how well\" testing explains the data  \"disease\". Keep in mind that $L(Disease|Positive)=P(Positive|Disease)$\n",
    "- Marginal Probability $P(Positive)$: The probability of getting a positive. This is calculatable based on existing information (distribution of no disease can be inferred):\n",
    "$$P(Positive)=P(Positive|Disease)\\cdot P(Disease)+P(Positive|No Disease)\\cdot P(No Disease) \\\\ \n",
    "= 0.95\\cdot 0.02 + (1-0.95) \\cdot (1-0.02) = 0.068$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can plug in these numbers:\n",
    "$$P(Disease|Positive)=\\frac{P(Positive|Disease)\\cdot P(Disease)}{P(Positive)}\n",
    "\\\\= \\frac{0.95\\cdot0.02}{0.068}=27.9\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the chance of actually getting the disease given that the testing is positive is only $27.9\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is very powerful when the understanding of the data is limited. When all the data is known (nearly impossible in many usecases), it is not that big of a deal. "

    "#### 1.Maching Learning Essentials\n",
    "##### Machine Learning Setup\n",
    "The goal of machine learning is to **make predictions** through training. The setup of ML includes the following:\n",
    "- Feature Space $\\mathcal{X}$: the **input** variables (called features) to describe the datapoint. Each dimension of the feature vector represents a feature: $\\mathcal{X}\\in \\mathcal{R}^d, X_i=[X_i^1,X_i^2,\\cdots,X_i^d]$\n",
    "- Label Space $\\mathcal{C}$: The label space is the possible **outputs** (called labels) that the model aims to predict. The range of label is determined by the nature of the model:\n",
    "    - Classification: $\\mathcal{C}={0,1}$ or $\\mathcal{C}={Y_1,Y_2,\\cdots,Y_n}$\n",
    "    - Regression: $\\mathcal{C}\\in \\mathcal{R}$\n",
    "- Training Data $\\mathcal{D}$: the set of datapoints used during training. It is the combination of the features and labels: $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{C}\\subseteq \\mathcal{R}^d\\times\\mathcal{C}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rough idea of machine learning is that the datapoints $(X,Y)$ are drawn from some unknown distribution, and we would like to learn (train) a function $h(x)=y$, or $h(x)\\approx y$ that is true for any new pairs of $(X,Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lost Functions\n",
    "Previously we mentioned training a function $h(x)=y$ to make predictions for new pairs of $(X,Y)$. It is normally done by defining and minimizing lost functions. A loss function $\\mathcal{L}(h)$ is a mathematical function that quantifies how **well** a machine learning model’s predictions **match the actual target values**. Depends on the type of models, lost function can be the difference between the predicted output and the true label or other form. Purpose of a loss function includes:\n",

    "The no free lunch theorem is a concept i Machine Learning where it states that **no single algorithm is universally better than all others**. This implies that it is impossible to find a single model that work absolutely best on all problems. For different tasks, we need to **make assumptions** on the data/system we are dealing with. For instance, in gaussian process, we assume that any finite set of value from the function that we try to model follows a multivariate gaussian distribution.\n",

The model is evaluated based on how **well it predicts the correct outputs** on unseen data and therefore supervised learning could further be splitted into **Regression(continuous prediction)** and **Classification(discrete prediction)**.

    "##### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the model learns from **unlabeled data**, meaning it does **not** have predefined outputs. The training set of unsupervised learning **does not** include a label for each feature input. The goal is to discover **patterns, structures, or relationships** in the data.

    "One **confusion** in linear regression notation is that the **intercept** is usually incorporated in the parameter vector $\\theta$.

In order to make the model work with this notation, an entry $X_0=1$ is added at the begining of the feature input, making its size **1 bigger than its original**. Therefore, in the case of **1D Linear Regression**, the feature and parameter **length** is **2**.\n",
