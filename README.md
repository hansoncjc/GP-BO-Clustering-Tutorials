# Jupyter Notebook Setup Guide

This guide will help you install Python; Jupyter Notebook, the carrier format in this repo; and VS Code, a powerful IDE to run jupyter notebook file.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1Ô∏è:Install Conda or Miniconda
Anaconda (and its light version miniconda) is a package and environment manager that help manage Python and its dependencies. It comes handy when we need to separate different environments(with different packages) for different tasks. Either Anaconda and Miniconda would work here.

#### 1.Install Conda
Download the installation package and follow guides.
- **[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section)** (Full package)
- **[Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)** (Lightweight version)

#### 2.Check Installation
After installation, check installation in terminal:
```bash
conda --version
```
you should see an output like `conda xx.x.xx`.
